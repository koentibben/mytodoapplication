### CRUD To-Do-List - created by Koen Tibben ###

This is a simple PHP + MySQL application in which you can create, edit and delete tasks. 
It also offers the possibility to print your to-do list. 

I'm using Bootstrap for the layout.

A prerequisite to run this application is having a (MySQL) database with a table named `tasks`, containing `id` (int) and `name` (varchar). See `db.php` for db "credentials".
